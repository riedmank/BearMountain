## Vulnerability Report
### insecure direct object references
	// Insecure direct object references would look like this
   public ActionResult Edit(int id)
       {
           var user = _context.Users.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Id == id);
           return View("Details", new UserViewModel(user);
       }
	- We can identify this issue by analyzing ids to ensure that they match what intend them to match to.
	We can fix this issue by using the following code:
	// Secure
   public ActionResult Edit(int id)
       {
           var user = _context.Users.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Id == id);
           // Establish user has right to edit the details
           if (user.Id != _userIdentity.GetUserId())
           {
               HandleErrorInfo error = new HandleErrorInfo(new Exception("INFO: You do not have permission to edit these details"));
               return View("Error", error);
           }
           return View("Edit", new UserViewModel(user);
       }
	- Essentially, we are checking the user ID twice. 
	- This is not an issue with dotnet Core as these issues would exist in any programming language.

### using components with known vulnerabilities
	- This vulnerability would possibly happen by using older versions of dotnet or by forgoing several patches and updates for dotnet core.  We will fix any possible vulnerabilities by ensuring that we are using the latest dotnet framework with all of the latest patches. We could also use the OWASP dependency checker to find any high level vulnerabilities.
